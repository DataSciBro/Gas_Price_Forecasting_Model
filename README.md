# Gas_Price_Forecasting_Model
This repository contains my gas price forecasting models. I used temperature and a Ukraine war dummy variable as predictors. The models effectively capture price fluctuations spurred by speculation around Europe banning Russian energy exports due to the conflict.

However, this model does not have enough explanatory variables to use in serious forecasting of future UK Gas Prices. Instead, it should be viewed as just a piece to a much larger puzzle of predicting future prices for this utility.
